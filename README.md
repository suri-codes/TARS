<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![TARS Tui][product-screenshot]](https://suri.codes/TARS_DEMO.png)

I've been thining about writing highly personal solutions that solve my problems
exactly rather than being satisfied by off-the-shelf tools.  I'm the kind of
person to work on 5 different things at the same time, and keeping track of what
I'm trying to do with each project while also balancing school assignments is a
chore. So, I decided to make some software that would help me keep track of
short-term and longterm goals while also being quick and easy to use!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This project only requires rust, preferably the latest release.

### Installation

I plan to distribute prebuilt binaries in the future but for now you can do the following to build and install locally.

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/suri-codes/TARS.git
   ```
2. Run the Daemon
   ```sh
   cargo run --bin tars-daemon
   ```
  If you want to use TARS long-term, I reccomend building the binary and adding this to your startup script. The TARS-TUI will not start without the daemon running. 
3. Run the TUI
   ```sh
  cargo run --bin tars-tui
   ```
  You can also alias this in your shell as `tars`.
